              Welcome to the very first vegan bistro on Jupiter's most beloved moon, Io! We are pleased to serve fresh mushrooms and produce foraged from the most secluded areas in space. We offer the prized Pluto Crimini and the Milky Way Morel, not to mention the rare Ring of Saturn Truffle. Run by 67 Generations of Miji women, we are happy to say we are an intergalactic family run establishment. We are proud to say all our food is locally produced in the Milky Way Galaxy and all our produce is farm to table.  We are an equal opportunity employer and welcome all races, species, belief systems, cyborgs and energy states.
