        <td>The Venusian Chanterelles are are handpicked by Libras and Tauruses on Venus, after which they are slow cooked for 4 hours with fragrant jasmine rice and saffron. Creamy and delicate. </td>
        <td>The Milky Way Morel only makes its appearance once every moon cycle in spring, so what treat! Breaded and deep fried like you would a traditional Italian meatball, you cannot go wrong. </td>
        <td>Traditional Truffles were hunted by wild boar in France, but this rare delicacy gives off its unique and pungent aroma before dawn, when it is easiest to smell by human foragers. Served crudo, dressed in olive oil and yuzu.</td>
